# Feature: Setup

## Context
We need to initialize the Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Convex backend. This provides the foundation for building the contact form feature.

## User Story
As a developer
I want a properly configured Next.js + Convex environment
So that I can build features efficiently with type safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next.js 14 project created with App Router
- [ ] TypeScript configured with strict mode
- [ ] Tailwind CSS installed and configured
- [ ] shadcn/ui set up with basic components
- [ ] Convex initialized and connected
- [ ] Basic project structure created per standards.md
- [ ] Environment variables configured (.env.local)
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] Git repository initialized with .gitignore

## Technical Notes
### Approach
1. Create Next.js app with TypeScript
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up shadcn/ui
4. Initialize Convex project
5. Create folder structure
6. Configure environment variables

### Components Needed
- Basic layout component
- Error boundary wrapper

### Data Model
- Initial Convex schema file (empty)

### API Endpoints
- Convex development/production URLs

## Dependencies
- **Uses**: None (foundation feature)
- **Modifies**: None
- **Blocks**: All other features

## Decision Log
- 2024-12-28: Initial spec created
- 2024-12-28: Chose App Router over Pages Router for better performance
- 2024-12-28: Selected shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
