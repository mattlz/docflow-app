# Feature: Project Setup

## Context
Initialize the [PROJECT NAME] project with [MAIN FRAMEWORK], [BACKEND], and core dependencies. This provides the foundation for building all subsequent features.

## User Story
As a developer
I want a properly configured development environment
So that I can build features efficiently with all necessary tools in place

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project initialized with [FRAMEWORK] and TypeScript
- [ ] [BACKEND/DATABASE] configured and connected
- [ ] Basic folder structure created per standards.md
- [ ] Environment variables configured (.env.local or similar)
- [ ] Linting and formatting configured (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Git repository initialized with .gitignore
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] Basic routing/navigation in place
- [ ] README with setup instructions
- [ ] Deployed to development environment (optional)

## Technical Notes
### Approach
1. Initialize project with framework CLI
2. Install core dependencies
3. Configure TypeScript
4. Setup backend/database connection
5. Create folder structure
6. Configure development tools
7. Create initial routes/screens

### Components Needed
- App entry point
- Basic layout/navigation
- Home/landing page
- Error boundaries
- Loading states

### Data Model
```typescript
// Initial schema structure
// Define core entities needed
```

### API Endpoints
- Health check endpoint
- Basic auth endpoints (if needed)

## Dependencies
- **Uses**: None (foundation feature)
- **Modifies**: None (creates everything)
- **Blocks**: ALL other features - must be completed first

## Decision Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial spec created
- YYYY-MM-DD: Chose [FRAMEWORK] because [REASON]
- YYYY-MM-DD: Selected [BACKEND] for [REASON]
