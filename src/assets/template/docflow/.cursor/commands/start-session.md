# Start Session

## Overview
Begin your work session by checking current progress and determining what to work on next.

## Steps

1. **Check Active Work**
   - Review ACTIVE.md for any work in progress
   - If active work exists, summarize current status
   - Ask: "Continue with [current work] or switch to something else?"

2. **Check Backlog** (if no active work)
   - Review INDEX.md for backlog items
   - Check if project setup is complete
   - If not, prioritize feature-project-setup/scaffold
   - Identify top priority item
   - Ask: "Ready to start on [item]? Let's review it first."

3. **Review Item** (if starting new work)
   - Load spec from /specs/backlog/
   - Check for completeness
   - Identify any missing information
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed

4. **Activate Work**
   - PHYSICALLY MOVE spec file from /specs/backlog/ to /specs/active/
   - Do NOT delete the original - use move/rename operation
   - Verify file exists in /specs/active/ after move
   - Update ACTIVE.md with current focus
   - Update INDEX.md to reflect active status
   - Create feature/bug branch if needed

5. **No Work Available**
   - If backlog is empty, offer to capture new work
   - Ask: "No active work or backlog items. Would you like to capture a new idea/feature/bug?"
